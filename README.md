# ttn-backend

Example repo of the imaginary app "Toad Town News." This repo would hold backend code for that application.

This repo's true purpose is to show how a reusable workflow (from ttn-workflows) can be called upon from a caller workflow (TODO NAME!). It's part of a greater example of how to checkout the reusable workflow's repository to access a script it has needed for certain work. 

See the ttn-workflows repo for much more detail.
